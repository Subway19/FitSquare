# FitSquare Webapp

## So far done:
+ Basic view for the gym listing page.
+ Separate Angular template to implement filters fast enough.

## Things to be done
+ Move the filters into the top navigation bar.
+ Add a view in the right side which will change it's contents based on the link clicked. Will have to use angular-route
+ Probably incorporate some colors from the Sails app into this page.
